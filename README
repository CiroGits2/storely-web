For anyone accessing this code, these are the important locations of the code that holds the website togther.

    The "src" folder contains all the code that makes the app "alive", all of it being sotred in "main" (src/main)

    The "storelyapp" folder (java/com/student/storelyapp) will contain all the Java files that manage the classes for the contacts, passwords, and users.
    It also contains the backbend controllers that connect the SQL database data to the main UI, being distinguishable by the "Controller" text one each of the files.

    The "resources" folder (src/resources) on the other hand, contains the "static" folder (src/resources/static) which stores 
    the HTML/CSS/Javascript code that build the main web page from scracth. Each html file represent a single web page with its own function, 
    text and format.

This text has the purpose of explaining the structure of the app and how to distinguish it. You are welcome
